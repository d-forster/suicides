# Suicide rates by country
Experiment in linear regression with data on suicide rates in various countries, along with their socioeconomic data.

**16/08/23:** Initial work included cleaning of data (such as improving column headings, reformatting data etc), as well as some preliminary data visualisation in the forms of two graphs: one of the amount of data by country, and the other a multi-line plot of GDP by country over time. The latter graph, however, is massively distorted due to the large GDP of countries like the USA and Japan. A more logical step to see the *majority* of the data would be to redo the plot and remove the "outlier" lines.
